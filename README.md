## Design


### Colour Scheme

![Color Scheme](<docs/images/Color Scheme.png>)
### Thoughts behind choosing this colour scheme:
Grayscale will never be outdated. It has a retro feel but also an intimate feel. It's timeless like this artist. Color scheme also show truth and genuinity, what you see is what you get. This colour-scheme reflects the artist the best.

### Typography
I only imported one font from googlefonts that i use for the logo and h2 describing sections of the site.

#### Protest Revolution
Reason behind this font is it felt a bit rebellish and a bit outside the box reflecting the artist and their personality and art.

It is accessible through google fonts, but i don't think it's that common.

![Protest Revolution](docs/images/protest-revolution.png)

Otherwise the fonts i've used are standard:
Verdana


### Imagery

Using one background image for all content:
![background image](assets/images/jelica-close-cover-bw-dark.jpg)

Wireframes were not used for this particular project

## Features

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### General features on each page

### Favicon
![Favicon](assets/favicon/favicon-32x32.png) that represents that it's a music page and more an artist, singer page.

The header is fixed and doesn't follow the flow of the rest of the page.

Consists of the logo (artist name) which also is a link to back to the homepage and a menu to the right to easily navigate to different pages.
The links changes color when hovering to easily know what you're mouse is pointing over. 
An active feature is added as an underline under the link to easily see what page you're on.

Background is fixed, and all the content in front of it moves without the background moving.

### The Homepage
The homepage consists of an about me section to read about the artist, what she is about and what her music is inspired. This page is very crucial to attract the visitor as we want them to click further on the links.

### Media Section
This page consist of header and embedded iframes of media. Spotify link and youtube links. The section is split up into 2 sections for clarity:
- Music section
- Video section
The padding is transparent but the videos and the content is not trasnsparent.

### Contact Section
The contact section consist of a h2 header and a form for the visitor to contact the artist.
The input-fields are required which means a user must input information in all fielfs for it to be able to submit.
A large textarea for the user to input a larger message for the communication to feel a bit more personal and intimate.
A bit submit button is added below the form to submit the contact form.

### 404 Error Page
Information when the user inputs a non existing webpage. Alert and information that the page cannot be reached and also a link to take the user back to the homepage.

### Future Implementations
- An update section where there is a "feature-section" like a new album or so. 
- Better source material, better quality and more proper links for the artist to express themselves.
- A Tour-section where visitors can follow the artist and come to their shows.
- An integrated section to maybe instagram or facebook to see latest photos or posts. 

### Accessibility

Added aria-labels on all links to help screen-readers better understand the project.

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Technologies Used

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Technologies Used section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#Technologies-Used)

### Languages Used

Make a note here of all the languages used in creating your project. For the first project this will most likely just be HTML & CSS.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

## Deployment & Local Development

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Deployment)

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

## Credits

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Credits section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm#Credits)

The Credits section is where you can credit all the people and sources you used throughout your project.

### Code Used

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

Who wrote the content for the website? Was it yourself - or have you made the site for someone and they specified what the site was to say? This is the best place to put this information.

### ¬†Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.
  
### ¬†Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
