## Design


### Colour Scheme

![Color Scheme](<docs/images/Color Scheme.png>)
### Thoughts behind choosing this colour scheme:
Grayscale will never be outdated. It has a retro feel but also an intimate feel. It's timeless like this artist. Color scheme also show truth and genuinity, what you see is what you get. This colour-scheme reflects the artist the best.

### Typography
I only imported one font from googlefonts that i use for the logo and h2 describing sections of the site.

#### Protest Revolution
Reason behind this font is it felt a bit rebellish and a bit outside the box reflecting the artist and their personality and art.

It is accessible through google fonts, but i don't think it's that common.

![Protest Revolution](docs/images/protest-revolution.png)

Otherwise the fonts i've used are standard:
Verdana


### Imagery

Using one background image for all content:

## Final Thoughts and Comments
## GENERAL EXPERIENCE
I probably ended up rebuilding the project 10-20 times not being happy. Started with different designs, single page, multi page, single page again. Colors no grayscale etc. The journey has been long but it has been very teachable and fun in the end.
