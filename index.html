            <h2>Who?</h2>
            <p>
                Is a creative individual who doesn’t do things like any ordinary artist would do. She is not about about only touching the surface but going deeper. She believes in the meaning and purpose behind every word one writes. By some she might be called “dramatic” but to her it's very important that there are no masks and there is pure genuinity and authenticity behind every word she puts on that piece of paper. 
                <br>
                <br>
                She has a very drive forward to make an impact and to inspire people out there, especially young girls to smash the barriers of society's perception of how one should look like and show that there are actually other paths and there is a bigger world out there. 
                <br>

                Through her music we can hear that she has had her fair share of struggles but in the same time to feel hope and to feel emotion. Through her words, the pain she feels, the emotion is so tangible having the listener know that it's not something manufactured but is from proper experience. Her emotion comes through. 
                <br>
                <br>
                In the end you make her music what you want to make it. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Jelica Thorn is one of a kind and we hope you can sit back and become part of the journey…
